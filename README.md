# MNIST-neural-network
A neural network designed to be trained on the MNIST dataset

You can get the dataset from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

An already trained network is included and can be loaded and tested.


If you have any questions, feel free to contact me under jabumaho@gmail.com, I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. I'm currently in my final year of school though, so it might take a few days for me to answer.
